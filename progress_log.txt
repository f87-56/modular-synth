Week 1 and 2:
The first week was uneventful in terms of the project. The exam week and other events consumed it nearly entirely.
I did manage to make a basic project setup.

At the end of the second week I managed to get the project under way. Most of the time during the week was spent learning
the basics of ScalaFX, as well as familiarizing myself with ScalaTest.
All in all, I have managed to build a basic skeleton from which functionality could be derived in the near future.

The KeyboardMidiControl class has been partially implemented and tested: Keystrokes can now generate correct Midi messages.
The classes SynthRuntime, ModularSynthesizer, SynthComponent, and Parameter have been partially implemented, but not tested.
As of now, they are not functional.

Though I am lagging behind when it comes to the project plan, that was to be expected. I would say that once I got things
started, the initial stage has been unexpectedly smooth. Thus far, no difficult errors have exhibited, but an unexpected
challenge regarding the synth's type structure has already presented itself.

The workload used during these two weeks was about 15 hours, not including any self-study or learning of frameworks.
I am lagging behind my planned schedule. I would say I'm about halfway to the point that the plan remarks. All of the features
remarked are still under construction. I was,however, half-expecting this: the coming week offers a slightly
more relaxed goal, which I can use to catch up.


Week 3 and 4:

I finally got to play my first notes!

I managed to solve my problems of the synth's internal type structure to a satisfactory level. This has thus far been the biggest
time drain. No new especially difficult problems have presented themselves.

I have spent the two weeks completing the implementations of SynthComponent and Parameter. This means fleshing out the
channels through which data flows, as well as the methods to link them together. A new type, RuntimeContext type provides to
the components information about the synth's state (e.g. the time). I have also fleshed out ModularSynthesizer's constructor.

Though I did not get to implementing all the wanted SynthComponents, the ones I have implemented have proven the abilities
of the program's design. Implementing new components is fairly straight-forward, as is building a synth from those components:
A component is implemented by extending the class SynthComponent, and defining its abstarct members "parameters" and
"output". Components are wired together by using the parameter's <== operator.

I'd say the SynthComponent class and Parameter class now have their final form.
Preliminary, manual testing has been applied to the new implemented features, though no systematic tests has been conducted.

Admittedly, the code is a rather messy state at the moment. Specifically SynthRuntime and ModularSynth consist of
somewhat-functional parts cobbled together for temporary testing. This should be addressed in the following weeks.
I now start, in general, to turn my gaze towards usability. This should be a big help when testing.

The workload spent on the project has been about 25 hours.

I am clearly lagging behind the project plan: I have still yet to integrate MIDI controls, I lack the filter component,
and the UI is still blank.


Week 5 and 6:

An issue regarding type erasure in the method <== came up (the method used to connect a component to another component's parameter),
meaning my Synth tree could not have been built as I would have expected. I came up with a workaround, but not before sending many hours
thinking of a "prettier" solution.

Notes can finally be played on the computer's keyboard. The framework has been laid for the use of any MIDI controller,
though this has not been tested. Some sound resources are currently accessed in an unsafe manner.

I have conducted some basic performance testing on the sound generation algorithm. With a minimal graph, the lower bound
of the update rate (how fast the synth can generate frames) was around 400kHz on my eight-year-old desktop computer (i7 6700k).
It seems performance is not a crippling issue.

A whole bunch is still missing from the program: From my "bare minimum" requirements, I have yet to implement different types of oscillators,
most of the synthesizer's main components, the node editor, as well as saving and loading files. From these, the former should not pose
greater issues. I feel I will have to dedicate a lot of time for the graph editor in the next two weeks.

I am severely behind the original plan. The features now present reflect a state roughly equivalent to the end of week 3 in it.

An approximate 12 hours has been used on this project during the last two weeks, a fair part of it fixing the issue with <==.
I have not been able to work much on this project during the last two weeks. I have had my focus on a project for another course.
Expect this number to grow dramatically for the next two weeks. If things go awry, expect me to be in contact.

Weeks 7 and 8:
To a great extent, the GUI has been implemented: The program now features a pannable, zoomable canvas with the ability of adding nodes to (A search
menu can be requested, and a component selected).
GUI analogues have been partially implemented.
Such classes as SynthCanvas and GUIWorkspace have been created, and the SynthComponents' analogues in the GUI.

Little has been systematically tested, but basic use testing has been conducted on SynthCanvas and GUIWorkspace in terms of the panning and zooming functionality,
as well as the function of the search box.

It turns out the issue with type erasure was not fixed. For the meantime, I choose to let it be, seeing as it is not a crucial issue in the program's function.

The main lacking features are the coupling of the synthesizer logic with the GUI (Editing the active synth using the GUI) and file handling (saving and loading synths).
The library of components is also minimal, and not very vast in the possibilities it offers.

I am still behind the planned schedule (According to it, I would be ready), and it seems the overall scope of the project will have to be restricted to meet the
imposed deadline.

Time in excess of 35 hours has been used on the project during the timespan.
