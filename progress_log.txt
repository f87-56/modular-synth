Week 1 and 2:
The first week was uneventful in terms of the project. The exam week and other events consumed it nearly entirely.
I did manage to make a basic project setup.

At the end of the second week I managed to get the project under way. Most of the time during the week was spent learning
the basics of ScalaFX, as well as familiarizing myself with ScalaTest.
All in all, I have managed to build a basic skeleton from which functionality could be derived in the near future.

The KeyboardMidiControl class has been partially implemented and tested: Keystrokes can now generate correct Midi messages.
The classes SynthRuntime, ModularSynthesizer, SynthComponent, and Parameter have been partially implemented, but not tested.
As of now, they are not functional.

Though I am lagging behind when it comes to the project plan, that was to be expected. I would say that once I got things
started, the initial stage has been unexpectedly smooth. Thus far, no difficult errors have exhibited, but an unexpected
challenge regarding the synth's type structure has already presented itself.

The workload used during these two weeks was about 15 hours, not including any self-study or learning of frameworks.
I am lagging behind my planned schedule. I would say I'm about halfway to the point that the plan remarks. All of the features
remarked are still under construction. I was,however, half-expecting this: the coming week offers a slightly
more relaxed goal, which I can use to catch up.


Week 3 and 4:

I finally got my first notes! It seems that
