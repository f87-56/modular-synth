This is a (structural, not literal) example of what a serialized synth looks like.

The structure of the files is as follows:
    The file contains a list of tuples. Each of those tuples holds:
        -The name of a synth component
        -Its position on the canvas
        -The serialized parameters of the SynthComponent. This is also a tuple.

    The file contains the output synth component separately. It holds the same data as
    all the other components.

A serialized SynthParameter contains:
    -The index in the toplevel list of the SynthComponent it was connected to. (-1 if none)
    -If the user can edit it (only for certain types), the set default value prior to serialization.
