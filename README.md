# modular-synth

A program in which you can build synthesizers from scratch using a node graph editor. This was done as a project for the course "Programming studio A" at Aalto University. The project was written in scala, but makes use of the java sound and javafx libraries. 

## Getting started

As the program is built in scala, running it will need a working installation of java. A .jar is provided under "out/artifacts/modular_synth.jar/modular_synth.jar".

## Features



For a primitive use guide, see [OS2_Final_Document.pdf](https://github.com/f87-56/modular-synth/blob/master/OS2_Final_Document.pdf).
